# ABSTRACT: distributed locks via ZooKeeper

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Net::ZooKeeper::Lock;

  # take a lock
  my $lock = Net::ZooKeeper::Lock->new({
      zkh => Net::ZooKeeper->new('localhost:2181'),
      lock_name   => 'bar',
  });

  # release a lock
  $lock->unlock;
  # or
  undef $lock;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module implements distributed locks via ZooKeeper using L<Net::ZooKeeper> and ZooKeeper recipe described at L<http://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/trunk/recipes.html#sc_recipes_Locks>. It doesn't implements shared locks, it will appear in the next releases.

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=cut

=item new($options)

Takes a lock and returns object that holds this lock. Throws exception if something goes wrong.

C<$options> is a hashref with following keys:

=over 4

=item blocking (optional)

By default module blocks in the C<new> method if lock already taken. If C<blocking> is C<false>, then C<new> doesn't wait if lock already taken and returns undef.

=item zkh

C<Net::ZooKeeper> object.

=item lock_prefix (optional)

"Directory" where sequential znodes for lock will be placed. It is good to make different prefixes for different locks if you have many locks (in this case C<Net::ZooKeeper::get_children()> will return data relevant only for one concrete lock. For example, it may looks like "/lock/foo1/" for "foo1" lock and "/lock/foo2" for "foo2" lock.

Default is just "lock".

=item lock_name

Name of your lock (it will be concatenated with C<lock_prefix> for creating template for sequential znodes).

=item create_prefix (optional)

If you want to store ephemeral znodes in C<lock_prefix>, then znode with name C<lock_prefix> should be created before creation of ephemeral znodes.

You can create this prefix znode once in your code. Or you can use C<create_prefix> flag, it will check and create C<lock_prefix> znode every time when you try to make new lock with C<lock_prefix>.

Default is 1.

=item data

Data to be stored in lock znode.

It may be useful to store the hostname and pid of the process, that created the lock.

Default is '0'.

=item lock_path

Returns the path of lock znode.

=cut

=item unlock

Releases getted lock. This method calls in destructor, so your lock releases when you go out of C<$lock> scope or when you call C<undef($lock)>.

=head1 MISCELLANEOUS

It seems that C<$SIG{PIPE}> signal doesn't occurs in C<Net::ZooKeeper> with new versions of ZooKeeper.

In this case following situation is possible: some process on some machine have taken the lock, then network disappeared on this machine, then another process on another machine can take the lock after C<session_limit>. And you have 2 processes that holds the same lock.

For such a case you can create some separate check-script that will test connection with ZooKeeper every N seconds < C<session_limit>. If connection lost, then this script can kill all processes on this machine that holds ZooKeeper locks.
